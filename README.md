# PostmanProj
FreeCodeCamp's course on Postman API integration.

Open up postman either through the application or on their website where they have a browser tool.

Click the import projcet button on the collection's tab.

Open up this json there and you will see the different API call's listed.

You can go through each one and see the test code and the variables.

To test all the request's at once, click on the three dots to the right of the collection name and click run collection.

This will run through each request and you can see if they are working correctly.


Here is a link to the API's documentation:

And here is a link to the video I watched to create this:
